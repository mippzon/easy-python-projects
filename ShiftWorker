# Hi I have a project with a cool idea, im sure im not the first to try but what the heck right?
# Anyways, I am doing a simplifed work flow.
# Not just any workflow but one to simply knowledge transfer at the end of a shift.
# The plan is to create a script that will ask alot of 1 letter response that equals alot.
# I want to save people to list if name has not been used before
# Once done it will make a txt file and email it to that individual.
# Sounds cool huh? Who's willing to help out? give some inputs thanks.
