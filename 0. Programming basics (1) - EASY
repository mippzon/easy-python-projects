Greeting,

    Hello and here are some of the basic I feel you should know inorder to
atleast become somewhat of a programmer.
There is a fear that" Once I learned the basic I still can't do anything'.
thats not true. Myself was that was and what made me learn how to program
was my girlfriend needed someone to motivate her to leave the healthcare field
so why not right?

I've made up 1000 excuses for why i can't learn how to program but once you
learn somewhat you are hooked! trust me

What i am learning for the most part:
what can be done in Java, can be done in Python... to some extent.

here are a list of things I've made just because.
    1. Videogame bots
    2. Autoscreen saver changer
    3. Calculators
    4. Hacking tools 
    5. Desktop applications
    6. Android applications
    7. Your broken key on the laptop
    8. alot more junk

I'll explain breifly on all items listed but 
'''

# type the word print to display things on screen from idle,
# print gives an output! try it!
# -- this is a variable: variables stores data
a=1000000


''' numbers variables do not require quotation mark such as '' or ""
some variables can be placed on the same line as long as they match up
such as (c=11 and b=12)'''
a=10
c,b=11,12
d=a+b+c

# variables can be reassigned :
    # before: a=10
    # after: a=20 
# or 
    # red=10
    # red='10'
    # red=10.0
# lets do some math
'''
booleans are True or False
true==true: true
true==false: false
false==false: true

        9+10==19   would return false
        9==9       would return true


<    means less than
>    means greather than
<=   means less than or equal to
>=   means more than or equal to
==   means equal to
!=   mean not equal to
